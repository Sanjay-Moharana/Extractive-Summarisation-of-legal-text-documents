"RANK #1   (HYBRID MODEL)                                                                                                                                                                    This score is achieved by modifying the TF-IDF score and applying the formula as stated in research paper.                                                                                                                                                     More precisely, New TF-IDF(Legal Term) = 2 * Old TF-IDF(Legal Term)                                            and  New TF-IDF(Non Legal Term) = Old TF-IDF(Non Legal Term) / 2                                                 We have taken the factor 2 because we wanted to make sure that legal terms should be   given  more importance than other. This is  because most of the Gold summary also prefer summary with legal terms.                                                                                                                                Why the number '2'? Through hit and trial the least number which satisfied our goal was '2'. The formula used as                                                                                                                                         Wnew = Wold + (sd * (1.5*L  +  0.2*d  +  0.3*e)) / length(Sentence), where                              Wnew : New sentence score                                                                                                                          Wold :  Old sentence score                                                                                                                                     sd : standard deviantion of sentence scores                                                                                                      L : Number of legal terms in the sentence                                                                                                         d : Total count of numeric digits (like year, case number, act, sec, rule etc)                                        e : number of entities present in the sentences",,,,,
