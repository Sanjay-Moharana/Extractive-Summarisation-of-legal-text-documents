1.  The impugned order, as usual, is a cryptic order. Be that as it may, the impugned order has been passed before the decision of this Court in the case of Assistant Commercial Taxes Officer vs. Bajaj Electricals Limited, reported in 2009 (1) S.C.C.308 2008 Indlaw SC 1921. Hence, the impugned order is set aside and the matter is remitted to the High Court for de novo consideration in the light of the decision of this Court, if applicable, in the case of Bajaj Electricals Limited 2008 Indlaw SC 1921 [supra].
2.  The civil appeal is, accordingly, allowed with no order as to costs.
