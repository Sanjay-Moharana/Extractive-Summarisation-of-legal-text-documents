1.  In this matter, the issue which arises for determination is whether "contract carriage" manufactured according to specifications is "tourist vehicle" and whether service provided by the assessee under "contract carriage" makes assessee a "tour operator" under Section 65(115) of the Finance Act,1994.
2. In our view, this question is important. It has wide implication on the Revenues. We find from the impugned judgment that there is no discussion on this point.
3.  In the circumstances, the impugned judgment is set aside and the matter is remitted to the High Court for de novo consideration in accordance with law.
Civil appeal is allowed accordingly.
Appeal allowed.
